# Kimi - an AI Agent for your startup.

Hey Kimi, what leads should I focus on this week?

...

Hey Kimi, were there any positive replies to last weeks LinkedIn outreach?

...

Hey Kimi, from now on please use Google's sales playbook when sending cold emails.

...

Hey Kimi, can you update HubSpot with the new leads?

...

These messages aren't being sent over slack to an SDR who doesn't respond on Fridays after 1pm (or when they're in homeoffice) - they're being asked to your AI business associate - Kimi.

Sales teams cost a lot. Startups hire expensive entry level SDRs, which have no experience, and expect them to provide them with great pipeline.

Kimi believes in a world where startups don't need 3 SDRs and 1 AE, but just 1 sales rep, or maybe just the founder to take meetings.

A world where AI does what it is meant to do - automate what it can, and leave the important stuff to humans.

Kimi can automate:
- Prospecting the perfect accounts for you
- Email outreach with multiple popular and effective sales playbooks to choose from
- LinkedIn outreach
- Lead engagement (sending the relevant case studies and info that your SDR doesn't want to do, to the lead who didn't want to commit, for months, until that customer is ready to buy)
- CRM updates and sync
- Meeting setting directly into your calendar
- Lead status tracking
- Account Management (Answering time consuming emails like "i forgot my password" or "can you add these 3 users for me" and looping you in to the important ones that need human interaction)

So who is Kimi for?

Kimi is for any business that has bigger things to focus on than their lead gen or small sales org. Small bootstrapped tech startups are a great example - we save you lots of money and give you interested customers on a silver platter.

We use the best sales playbooks in the world, created by CROs and CSOs at massive companies that pay them millions a year. You can even choose which one fits best to your business and experiment!
